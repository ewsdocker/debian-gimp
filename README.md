### ewsdocker/debian-gimp:9.6.0  

**Gimp (complete) in a Debian-based Docker image.**  

#### GitHub Current Source is EDGE
The _9.6.1_ version is now under development. It will show itself as _EDGE_ in Docker hub Tags.  

The _9.6.0_ and _EDGE_ tags are development versions of GitHub source and Docker image, respectively.  

For working source/image, stick with the current release tag (_9.6.0_).  

**NOTE**  
**ewsdocker/debian-gimp** is designed to be used on a Linux system configured to support **Docker user namespaces** .  

Refer to [ewsdocker Containers and Docker User Namespaces](https://github.com/ewsdocker/ewsdocker.github.io/wiki/UserNS-Overview) for an overview and information on running **ewsdocker/debian-gimp** on a system not configured for **Docker user namespaces**.

____  
#### Installing ewsdocker/debian-gimp  

The following scripts will download the the selected **ewsdocker/debian-gimp** image, create a container, setup and populate the directory structures, create the run-time scripts, and install the application's desktop file(s).  

The _default_ values will install all directories and contents in the user's home directory on the **Docker host** (refer to [Mapping docker host resources to the docker container](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-gimp/wiki/QuickStart#mapping)),  
____  
**ewsdocker/debian-gimp:latest**  
  
    docker run --rm \
               -v ${HOME}/bin:/userbin \
               -v ${HOME}/.local:/usrlocal \

#### Running the installed scripts

After running the above command script, and using the settings indicated, the docker host directories, mapped as shown in the above tables, will be configured as follows:

+ the executable scripts have been copied to **~/bin**;  
+ the application desktop file(s) have been copied to **~/.local/share/applications**, and are availablie in any _task bar_ menu;  
+ the associated **debian-gimp-"version"** executable script (shown below) will be found in **~/.local/bin**, and _should_ be customized with proper local volume names.

#### Bleeding-edge Testing  

The _bleeding-edge_ development tag **edge** is the next **Docker** tag release.  This means that, during its lifetime, the **edge** source will undergo many modifications before it becomes useful.  

For the _very brave_, if an _edge_ tag is available, the following  instructions will download, rename and install the _edge_ version.  

Good luck.  Please remember that just because it is named **9.6.1** does **not** mean that it is no longer bleeding-**edge**. Don't expect it to work.

____  

**ewsdocker/debian-gimp:edge**  

**edge** is the **Docker** tag for the **GitHub** development version, and future **Docker** release tag, **9.6.1**.  

    docker pull ewsdocker/debian-gimp:edge
    docker tag ewsdocker/debian-gimp:edge ewsdocker/debian-gimp:9.6.1
    docker run --rm \
               -v ${HOME}/bin:/userbin \
               -v ${HOME}/.local:/usrlocal \
               -e LMS_BASE="${HOME}/.local" \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker:/conf \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-gimp-9.6.1:/root \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/debian-gimp-9.6.1/workspace:/workspace \
               --name=debian-gimp-9.6.1 \
           ewsdocker/debian-gimp:9.6.1 lms-setup  

optional step (clean up the **docker images**):

    docker rmi ewsdocker/debian-gimp:edge  

To create and run the container, run **Gimp (9.6.1)** from the _Graphics_ category of any desktop menu, or the following should work from the command-line:

    ~/.local/bin/debian-gimp:9.6.1  

____  

#### About the size of the image  

The main design specifications of the **ewsdocker** desktop application images are:  

  - Provide the same desktop experience as the user would have on a full application installation on a host desktop (including desktop menu interface, audio, video, multimedia, ...);  
  - Install the latest release directly from the software vendor's repository, or a certified mirror, reducing dependencies on host operating system implementations of the application;  
  - Leverage **Docker** container capabilities to  
   + provide isolation of the **Docker** container applications from the **Docker** host;  
   + provide persistence of application settings between **docker run** commands, and between future releases, allowing fast container deletion and re-creation; and  
   + quickly perform container replications, container updates, and recovery from software malfunction/corruption.  

Most of the **ewsdocker** desktop application images are based on the latest **Debian** docker image, since fewer problems have been encountered when implementing the desktop applications on that platform.  

Obviously, these **Docker** images tend to be rather large compared to most **Docker** images. It may take a bit longer to download, but the convenience of having the application in a **docker image** is worth the small, (usually) one time investment in download time.
